Describe several measurable attributes of a single object."K.MD.2,Math,K,MD,,Describe and compare measurable attributes.,2,,Measurement and Data,,"Directly compare two objects with a measurable attribute in common, to see which object has ""more of""/""less of"" the attribute, and describe the difference. For example, directly compare the heights of two children and describe one child as taller/shorter."K.MD.3,Math,K,MD,,Classify objects and count the number of objects in each category.,3,,Measurement and Data,,Classify objects into given categories; count the numbers of objects in each category and sort the categories by count. (Limit category counts to be less than or equal to 10.)K.G.1,Math,K,G,,"Identify and describe shapes (squares, circles, triangles, rectangles, hexagons, cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres).",1,,Geometry,,"Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using terms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to."K.G.2,Math,K,G,,"Identify and describe shapes (squares, circles, triangles, rectangles, hexagons, cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres).",2,,Geometry,,Correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or overall size.K.G.3,Math,K,G,,"Identify and describe shapes (squares, circles, triangles, rectangles, hexagons, cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres).",3,,Geometry,,"Identify shapes as two-dimensional (lying in a plane, ""flat"") or three-dimensional (""solid"")."K.G.4,Math,K,G,,"Analyze, compare, create, and compose shapes.",4,,Geometry,,"Analyze and compare two- and three-dimensional shapes, in different sizes and orientations, using informal language to describe their similarities, differences, parts (e.g., number of sides and vertices/""corners"") and other attributes (e.g., having sides of equal length)."K.G.5,Math,K,G,,"Analyze, compare, create, and compose shapes.",5,,Geometry,,"Model shapes in the world by building shapes from components (e.g., sticks and clay balls) and drawing shapes."K.G.6,Math,K,G,,"Analyze, compare, create, and compose shapes.",6,,Geometry,,"Compose simple shapes to form larger shapes.
